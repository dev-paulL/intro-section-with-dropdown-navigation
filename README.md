## My process

- Analyzed the screenshots _(design folder)_ to determine how to structure the page, and how much time I would take to replicate it.
- Started with the mobile design since it looked less complex, then implemented its basic navigation menu.
- Implemented the dropdown menus.

- After completing the mobile version, modified the different elements to ensure my desktop version matched the screenshots.
